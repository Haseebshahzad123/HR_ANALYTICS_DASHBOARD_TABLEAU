# HR_ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD_TABLEAU
This HR Analytics Dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the employee population and attrition trends of an organization.<br>
The dashboard was created using Tableau and is Haseeb Shahzad's first project, likely based on a dataset from Kaggle.<br>

The dashboard includes the following key metrics and visualizations:<br>
• Employee Count, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Active Employees, and Average Age<br>
• Department-wise Attrition Rates<br>
• Number of Employees by Age Group<br>
• Job Satisfaction Ratings across different job roles<br>
• Attrition Rate by Gender for different Age Groups<br>

These insights can help HR professionals and business leaders better understand their employee population, identify areas of concern, and make informed decisions to improve employee retention and overall workforce management.<br>

As this is MY first Tableau project, it demonstrates their ability to collect, analyze, and visualize HR data to derive actionable insights. The project showcases their data analysis skills and ability to create an intuitive and informative HR Analytics Dashboard using Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities.<br>
